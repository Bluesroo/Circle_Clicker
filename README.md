#Circle_Clicker

The point of this game is to click 10 randomly generated squares which pop up on the screen. It is very basic and I used
it to teach myself a little about C++, event based programming, and graphics programming (with the help of [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org/index.php)).

####Note:
    This is a very old project and will only compile on Linux (I believe)
