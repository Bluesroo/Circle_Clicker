#Circle_Clicker

The point of this game is to click 10 randomly generated squares which pop up on the screen. It is very basic and I used
it to teach myself a little about C++, event based programming, and graphics programming (with the help of [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org/index.php)).

##Files
###[game.cpp](https://github.com/Bluesroo/Circle_Clicker/blob/master/game.cpp) and [game.h](https://github.com/Bluesroo/Circle_Clicker/blob/master/game.h)
game.cpp is the main entry point for the program and game.h contains the important declarations and includes.
###[circleClicker.cpp](https://github.com/Bluesroo/Circle_Clicker/blob/master/circleClicker.cpp) and [endOfGame.cpp](https://github.com/Bluesroo/Circle_Clicker/blob/master/endOfGame.cpp)
These files are the game and endgame screen.
###[wrappers.h](https://github.com/Bluesroo/Circle_Clicker/blob/master/wrappers.h)
wrappers.h contains a couple classes that were extended in order to help with the functionality.

####Note:
    This is a very old project and will only compile on Linux (I believe).
