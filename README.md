Circle_Clicker
==============

A silly game I made using SFML in order to expose myself to some basics regarding C++, OO design, and graphics.

The whole point of the game is to click 10 randomly generated squares as fast as possible. That's literally it.

Note: Some of the formatting/ indents got foobarred when I pushed the project to git.
